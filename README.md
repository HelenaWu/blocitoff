HEY! This is the README for Bloccitoff, a self-deleting todo list application that allows users to create to-do items and mark them off as they are completed. To-do items are destroyed after 7 days.

###("if not done after the first 7 days, then it's probably not important enough!") 
harsh eh? that's the punishment for procrastination :)
